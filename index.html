            <h3> Technical Interests </h3>
            <p>Currently, I am interested in Software Engineering and Cybersecurity. Writing basic programs and learning through simple
            exercises sparked my passion for computer science. As the programs got more advanced and impactful, I realized I had found something
            that incorporated problem-solving, creativity, organization, and collaboration in a fast, immersive, and relevant field, which ultimately
            led to my decision to pursue computer science as my major. A few semesters ago, I participated in a beginner's Hack The Box competition,
            which exposed me to the vast field of Cybersecurity. Since then, I have continued to pursue a path in cybersecurity.

                <p>
                    In the summer of 2019, I volunteered with an association to teach English abroad to children in disadvantaged regions of 
                    Taiwan. This experience lead me to a city school in Chiayi, Taiwan, where I taught English to elementary school children 
                    for 4 weeks. Here, I bridged the gap between Mandarin and English and fostered a rich learning environment for students 
                    to better understand English.

                <p>
                    At age 16, I completed my Eagle Scout Project with the Boy Scouts of America. My project involved building and installing 
                    2 benches and over 30 Emergency Locator Posts for a local park, as well as creating a new park map for the trailhead, website, 
                    and emergency personnel. The project took many months of planning, securing necessary paperwork and permissions, and labor, 
                    totaling over 400 hours of work to complete the project.
